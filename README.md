This is developed website of My Portfolio: https://xh05hfof1pmwc1ragh0jiq.on.drv.tw/www.Akhilmportfolio.com/
1. The HTML Structure (The Base)

We have a webpage with different sections: "Home," "About," "Portfolio," and "Contact." Think of these as the rooms in your LEGO house.
Each section has a div (like a container) with a specific id (like a name tag) to help us find it later.
Inside each section, there are headings (<h1>, <h2>), paragraphs (<p>), images (<img>), and lists (<ul>, <li>). These are the furniture and decorations in your rooms.

2. The CSS Styling (The Paint Job)
The style.css file is like the instruction manual for how the LEGO house should look.
It tells the webpage what colors to use, how big the fonts should be, and where to put everything.
For example, it might say "make the headings big and blue" or "put the image on the left side of the page."

3. The JavaScript Magic (The Moving Parts)
JavaScript is like the engine that makes things happen in your LEGO house.
It lets you do things like:
Make the mobile menu slide in and out when you click the hamburger icon.
Switch between the "Skills" and "Education" tabs in the "About" section.
Send a message through the contact form.

4. The Google Sheets Connection (The Mailbox)
The code connects to a Google Sheet, which is like your online mailbox.
When someone fills out the contact form, JavaScript sends the message to the Google Sheet.
This way, you can keep track of all the messages people send you.

5. The Font Awesome Icons (The Stickers)
The code uses Font Awesome, which is like a library of stickers with different icons.
These icons make the webpage look nicer and easier to understand.
For example, there's a paper plane icon for the email address and a phone icon for the phone number.

In simple words, this code creates a webpage with different sections, styles it to look nice, and adds some interactive elements using JavaScript. It also connects to a Google Sheet to store messages from the contact form.
