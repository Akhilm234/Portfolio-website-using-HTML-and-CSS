This repository contains the code for a personal website showcasing skills, experience, and contact information.  The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features:

*   **Clear Structure:**  Organized into sections for Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact, providing easy navigation for visitors.
*   **Modern Design:**  Styling is implemented with CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive layout, adapting to different screen sizes.
*   **Interactive Elements:**  JavaScript enhances user experience with features like a mobile-friendly navigation menu, tabbed content in the About section (e.g., Skills/Education), and form submission handling.
*   **Contact Form Integration:**  A contact form allows visitors to send messages directly, with data securely stored using a Google Sheets backend and Google Apps Script.  (Note:  The Google Apps Script code is included for reference but requires setup in your own Google account).
*   **Font Awesome Icons:**  Integrated Font Awesome icons enhance the visual appeal and clarity of the website's elements.

This project serves as a demonstration of front-end web development skills, including HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity, as well as integration with external services like Google Sheets.  It's designed to be easily customizable and adaptable for individual portfolios or personal websites.
